##### Prep & Cook Time: 10 min; 1hr 15 min 


----------------- 
### Equipment 
* 8 inch (2 quart) baking dish 
* mixing bowl
* salad shooter 
* knife  
* cutting board 
-------------------- 
### Ingredients 
* Butter to grease the glassware  
* 2 large Russett Potatoes 
* 1.5 tsp salt 
* 0.25 tsp black pepper
* 1 cup (4 oz) finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 
* 2.5 cups heavy whipping cream  
* thyme for garnish 
----------------- 
### Instructions 
1. Preheat oven to 350 F  
2. Grease baking dish with butter 
3. Slice Potatoes with salad shooter to thin slices in a mixing bowl 
4. Toss the potatoes with salt and pepper 
5. Arrange some of the potato slices, edges overlapping, in a single layer on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle a quarter of the cheese over the potatoes, and then pour a quarter of the cream over the cheese. Repeat with the remaining potatoes, cheese, and cream, forming 4 layers. Pour any leftover cream over top. 
6. Place in oven and bake for 1 hr 15 min, or until potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife and golden brown on top. Let dish settle on counter for about 10 min. Sprinkle with thyme to finish. 

#### Make Ahead: 
This dish can be assembled a day ahead; cover tightly with plastic wrap (pressing the wrap directly against the potatoes so they donâ€™t discolor), store in the refrigerator, and bake before serving. The potatoes on top will still discolor a bit in the fridge, but it shouldn't be noticeable after baking.
