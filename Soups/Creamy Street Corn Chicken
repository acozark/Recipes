Directions:

Marinate the Chicken:

In a small bowl, mix the olive oil, lime juice, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.
Place the chicken in a resealable bag or shallow dish and pour the marinade over. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours in the refrigerator.
Cook the Chicken:

Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.
Grill the chicken for 6-8 minutes per side, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C).
Let the chicken rest, then slice into thin strips.
Prepare the Street Corn:

If using fresh corn, grill the cobs until charred, then cut off the kernels. For frozen or canned corn, heat in a skillet.
In a bowl, mix mayonnaise, sour cream, lime juice, chili powder, smoked paprika (if using), and cotija cheese. Stir in the warm corn and cilantro until fully coated.
Prepare the Rice:

In a bowl, toss the cooked rice with lime juice and cilantro.
Assemble the Bowls:

Divide the cilantro-lime rice into bowls. Top with sliced chicken and a portion of the street corn.
Add optional toppings like avocado, tomatoes, jalapeños, extra cheese, and lime wedges.
Serve:

Serve warm with extra lime wedges for a fresh squeeze of citrus. Enjoy!
